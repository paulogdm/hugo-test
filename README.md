# Hugo Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Hugo on Now, you can use the [Hugo CLI](https://gohugo.io/commands/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ hugo new site project-name
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Hugo example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
